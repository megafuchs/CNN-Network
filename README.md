# CNN-Network

This repository contains part of a larger project where I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The model was trained using a custom dataset of images, all of which I captured personally. After training, the model achieved an accuracy of 55% on unseen test data.

### Results

After training the CNN on the custom image dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 55% on the test data.

### Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
